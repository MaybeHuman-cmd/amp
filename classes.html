					<h3>Single Watt Plus</h3>
					<p>
						The Single Watt Plus amplifier adds more to the popular One Watt model. 

More Power: The Single Watt Plus has a pair of 6V6 tubes running in parallel for 10 watts of clean power, and 18 watts of harmonically rich overdriven power. Onboard power scaling drops the amp from 10 watts down to 1 watt so you can get the grind at bedroom volume with no change in tone. 

More Speaker: Available as a 12" combo, the One Watt Plus can move as much or as little air as you want it to. A bigger cabinet translates into more overall power. The Jupiter small magnet ceramic is transparent with a scooped sound. Upgrade to a Celestion Alnico Blue, and this amplifier becomes a rock box with added midrange focus and punch.

					<h3> Wonderland Dirty
					</h3>
					<p>
						The Wonderland Dirty is a single channel amp design, with bold and full-bodied blackface style tones. Its voice is uncompressed and open, revealing a unique tonal breath with even light pick attack. Plugging into the amp, you can adjust the three-band EQ or select any of the three EQ boost switches, bright/mid/deep; which allow for a great deal of flexibility when dialing in. The amp has a preamp gain volume and a transparent master volume that allow you to crank up the preamp when you want more attitude in your playing. While the amp is certainly a ‘clean’ style amp, the Dirty Wonderland received its name from the two ‘dirty’ switches on the back. The switch by the effects loop breaks up the preamp and the switch by the speaker jacks breaks up the power amp. These switches are very effective when trying to get more gain at lower volume settings. When the amp is at higher volume you can get a killer crunch by engaging the switches.

					<h3> Overdrive Wonderland v2</h3>
					<p>
						The Overdrive Wonderland is in a class of its own.  Big shimmery cleans and a throaty high gain overdrive fuse into a versatile amplifier that will take your guitar tone to the next level.  This amp is easy to dial in and includes onboard spring reverb and half power.

The clean channel of this amp has a great American voicing that is reminiscent of a vintage Fender amp. You will recognize the balanced EQ immediately and feel a connection with the amp that allows you to dig in.  It can stay loud and clean, providing excellent headroom and a great pedal platform.

The drive channel has a smooth overdrive with complex harmonics and a honky growl. Fully loaded with tones from classic rock to blues to hard rock and funk, the amp will give up the goods. The amp has incredible sustain and bloom, chirp, and the perfect amount of sensitivity to your pick attack.  There are easy ways to fine tune your sound, including EQ boosts and “Preamp Boost” on both channels.
