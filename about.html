				<h3>Best Boutique Amp for Professional musician</h3>
				<p>
					Vintage amplifier  is a boutique guitar amplifier manufacturer located just outside of Boston MA. We began our quest for tone by offering vintage amplifier restoration and repair. We quickly graduated to opening our own custom cabinet shop for amplifier enthusiasts and hobby builders. Soon after, we started designing and selling our own tube guitar amplifiers. Our products emulate the sounds of legendary artists and pay homage to the rarest and most sought-after amplifiers ever created. With relentless attention to detail and a firm commitment to the customer experience we have connected with thousands of people across the world.

				<h3>Location</h3>
				<p>
					Currently we operate out of Hudson, MA with all products designed and handmade by master builder James B. Cox. Taylor has been playing guitar his entire life and has extensive knowledge and experience with authentic Dumble amplifiers. He is well known in the boutique guitar gear industry and highly regarded as one of the finest guitar amplifier builders. James’s wife Betty is a valuable asset to Amplified Nation, spearheading our marketing, graphic design, and helping with artist relations.
